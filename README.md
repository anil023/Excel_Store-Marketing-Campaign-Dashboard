# Store Marketing Campaign
Data from a superstore marketing campaign is accessible on Kaggle [(link)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/superstore-marketing-campaign-dataset). The primary aim of this repository is to conduct a comprehensive data analysis on the provided dataset using Microsoft Excel. The main objectives of this analysis are to identify the marketing campaign that will maximize sales profits for the store and to determine distinct customer age groups for potential future customer acquisition projects.

This dataset served as the foundation for conducting extensive data analysis and generating various visualizations using Microsoft Excel. Furthermore, it served as the inspiration for the development of an Excel dashboard and Microsoft presentation, which were created to effectively communicate and showcase the final analytical findings.
