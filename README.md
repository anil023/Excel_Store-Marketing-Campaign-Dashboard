# Store Marketing Campaign
## Define the Question
Data from a superstore marketing campaign is accessible on Kaggle [(link)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/superstore-marketing-campaign-dataset "Kaggle Link to the Dataset"). This repository documents the comprehensive data analysis conducted on the provided dataset using Microsoft Excel. The primary objectives of this analysis include identifying the marketing campaign that will maximize sales profits for the store and pinpointing specific customer age groups for potential future customer acquisition projects.

The dataset served as the cornerstone for performing in-depth data analysis and generating a variety of visualizations using Microsoft Excel. Additionally, it served as the source of inspiration for creating an Excel-based dashboard and a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation

## Data Cleaning
- The raw dataset had 2206 row items, of which 184 were determined as **duplicates** and hence deleted to create the initial "Worksheet" sheet in the Excel.
- The **Age** numerical variable is converted into a categorical variable **Age Brackets**. Similarly we also built **Income Brackets**, **Last Purchase**, **Website Visits** and **Customer Loyalty**.
- The **Education Status** is a categorical variable that combines corresponding columns from the raw dataset. Similarly we also created **Marital Status**.
- Remaining variables are renamed to ease of understanding the dataset.
